# Solana Avatars

**Solana Avatars** is a smart contract that acts as a Web3 virtual world passport.  
Each user is assigned a **Program Derived Address (PDA)** which stores their avatar profile on-chain. Users can:

- Create, update, and delete their avatar account
- Attach metadata such as username, description and **3D avatars** using NFT Mint Pubkey
- Apply any **3D avatar NFT** to represent themselves in virtual reality environments

This allows for seamless identity integration across decentralized worlds.

## 🖼 Frontend Interface

We built a complete UI for interacting with the Solana Avatars smart contract.  
Through the interface, users can:

- Mint their 3D avatar NFTs directly from the frontend
- Configure their Web3 passport with custom usernames, descriptions, and NFT-linked avatars
- Dynamically switch or update their on-chain identity for use across decentralized applications

The UI is designed to simplify onboarding and customization in the Web3 realm.

The frontend is located in `./app` and built using the [Remix](https://remix.run/) framework.
