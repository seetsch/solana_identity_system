## 🧠 Overview

Solana Avatars enables users to create persistent, customizable identities for use across decentralized applications and virtual worlds. It combines two core smart contracts to power a flexible, user-centric avatar system:

- 🪪 **Profile Contract** — Acts as your Web3 passport, storing identity data such as usernames, bios, and chosen avatar NFTs on-chain via PDAs (Program Derived Addresses).
- 🛠 **Avatar Minter Contract** — Allows creators to deploy NFT avatar collections with configurable fees and total supply, enabling others to mint and use them in metaverses.

Creators earn rewards from minting fees (UI for claiming is coming soon).

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Create Your Profile** — Set up your Web3 passport with a username, description, and linked avatar NFT.
2. **Deploy or Mint Avatars** — Use the Minter UI to publish collections or mint from existing ones.
3. **Explore the Metaverse** — Represent yourself anywhere in the decentralized world using your 3D avatar.

## 🖼 Frontend Interface

We built a full-featured UI using [Remix](https://remix.run/) located in `./app`. The interface allows users to:

- Mint their 3D avatar NFTs directly from the browser
- Create and update their Web3 profile (username, bio, avatar NFT)
- Dynamically manage and switch on-chain identities
- Deploy their own NFT avatar collections
- Set mint price and supply
- Mint avatars via UI for personal use

This intuitive interface lowers the barrier for both users and creators to participate in Web3 identity creation.
