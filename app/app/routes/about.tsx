        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          On the <strong>Home</strong> page, you can configure your appearance and style in a 3D Web3 metaverse space.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Visit the <strong>Users</strong> page to see all registered users who have created profiles.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          On the <strong>Deployer</strong> page, you can create your own NFT minter where others can mint NFTs based on your 3D model. You can also specify a commission, which you can later claim as rewards when users purchase your avatars (in progress).
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          The <strong>Minter</strong> page is an open market where you can discover avatars shared by other creators. Choose the ones that suit your style and budget.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Finally, the <strong>Ekza</strong> page links to the Ekza metaverse playground, where you can test your avatar, meet other users, and see them moving in real time.
